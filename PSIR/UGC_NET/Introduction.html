      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Historical Context: From Divine Rule to Rational Authority
The liberal theory of the state arose in Europe during the Enlightenment (17th–18th centuries), a transformative period that challenged the twin pillars of monarchical absolutism and religious orthodoxy. Liberalism emerged as an ideological response to centuries of feudalism, tyranny, and clerical domination. Thinkers like John Locke, Thomas Hobbes, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau redefined political authority—not as a divine right but as a contractual arrangement grounded in human reason, dignity, and consent.
This was a profound shift from the medieval worldview, where rulers were seen as God’s representatives and subjects as mere dependents. Liberalism, inspired by the scientific revolution and secular humanism, placed the individual at the centre of political theory, thus marking the birth of modern political thought.
In India, similar ideas were introduced during colonial rule and became central to the anti-colonial struggle. Leaders like Dadabhai Naoroji, Gopal Krishna Gokhale, and Jawaharlal Nehru adopted liberal principles to frame demands for self-governance, civil liberties, and constitutionalism. The Indian Constitution, shaped in this milieu, stands as one of the most comprehensive liberal charters in the Global South.</p>

<h2>Core Assumptions of the Liberal State</h2>
<p>1. Individual Rights as Natural and Inviolable
At the core of liberal theory is a profound belief in the inherent dignity, autonomy, and rationality of the individual. Unlike systems of governance where rights are granted by the state or ruler, liberalism holds that certain rights are pre-political, natural, and inalienable. These rights exist independently of the state and must be protected by any legitimate government. John Locke, the seminal liberal thinker, encapsulated this in his Two Treatises of Government (1689), where he argued that rights to life, liberty, and property are natural rights—fundamental to human existence and must be safeguarded by the state, not bestowed by it.
For Locke, the purpose of government was not to grant these rights but to ensure their protection. The government, according to Locke, is a trustee of the people, established to create a system that secures these fundamental rights and freedoms. These ideas formed the philosophical backbone of liberal constitutionalism, influencing the development of modern liberal democracies, particularly in the United States and Western Europe.<p>

<h2>Natural Rights and the State</h2>
<p>The core idea here is that individuals possess intrinsic rights—rights that are not contingent upon legal systems or governments, but are inherent to their human nature. According to liberalism, the state has the responsibility to protect these rights, not the authority to grant or restrict them. This is a radical departure from pre-liberal political philosophy, where rights were often seen as privileges granted by monarchs or divine authority.
In India, this Lockean legacy is manifest in Part III of the Constitution, which guarantees Fundamental Rights—a direct extension of the liberal belief that the individual must be safeguarded from state overreach. These rights, including the right to equality, freedom of speech and expression, religion, and constitutional remedies, form the ethical foundation of Indian democracy. The right to life and personal liberty (Article 21) is especially significant, ensuring that no person shall be deprived of these rights except according to procedure established by law. This ensures a legal framework where individual rights cannot be arbitrarily infringed by the state.<p>
